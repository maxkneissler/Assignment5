## Introduction

The goal of this assignment to use a public Github repository to improve the
version control system and to manage the development history of this project
carefully. We will interact with the API of ticketmaster.com in a basic and an
advanced way to obtain data from event venues in Germany. We will make use of
this data by plotting a map of Germany, indicating the event locations in
Germany. In addition, this precedurer is repeated for another European country.
I was working together with Elias Rudolph (Student ID: 5629871) and Nicolas 
Mollier (Student ID: 5640171)in this assignment to deepen the exchange about
